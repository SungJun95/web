  <p style="margin-top:45px;"> Development of cat breeds started in the mid 19th century.
    An analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in
    the process of domestication as specific mutations were selected to develop cat breeds. Most breeds are founded on random-bred
    domestic cats. Genetic diversity of these breeds varies between regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than 20
    deleterious genetic disorders. </p>
